INNOCHAT makes it quick and effortless to integrate an intelligent AI-powered chatbot into your Slack workspace. By adding INNOCHAT
to Slack, your team can instantly access advanced AI capabilities, enhancing collaboration and efficiency.

In just a few minutes, you can deploy a INNOCHAT chatbot across your company’s Slack channels to streamline communication,
boost productivity, and improve the employee experience. The chatbot can understand natural language, provide instant responses to
common queries, assist with troubleshooting, retrieve information, and offer 24/7 automated support—all within Slack.

## Get Started with Your INNOCHAT Chatbot

These steps assume you’ve already created an INNOCHAT account and have an INNOCHAT chatbot ready to use. If you haven’t,
sign up for a free INNOCHAT account and create your first AI chatbot. For example, you could build a company FAQ chatbot to instantly answer common employee questions, a support bot to handle
customer inquiries through chat, or a team collaboration bot to
assist Slack teams by answering queries, summarizing conversations, and providing brainstorming suggestions. Get your chatbot
tailored to your needs before proceeding with integration. If you don’t have a chatbot, you might want to explore [creating one with INNOCHAT](/creating-first-chatbot) to get started.

## Find Slack Integration

Once your chatbot is ready, select the one you want to integrate with Slack and proceed to the **"Go Live"** section. In this section, you’ll find the Slack integration option. Select it to move forward with the integration process.
