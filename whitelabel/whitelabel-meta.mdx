title: Meta Integration Process
---

To integrate Meta (Facebook Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp) with your GPT-trainer, follow these steps:

## 1. Create a Meta App

First, you need to create a Meta App of the "Business" type to access the necessary messaging APIs. Refer to [Meta's guide](https://www.google.com/search?q=insert_meta_guide_link_here) for detailed instructions on how to do this.

## 2. Obtain App Secrets

Once your Meta App is created, navigate to the "App settings" section in your Meta App Dashboard. Here, you will find your **App ID** and **App Secret**. Copy these values and paste them into the "Integrations" tab of your GPT-trainer Partners Dashboard.

You also need to generate a **Verification Token**. This can be any secure alphanumeric string (at least 32 characters is recommended). You can use a password generator for this. Enter this token in the designated field within the GPT-trainer Partners Dashboard and save it for your records.

## 3. Add Products to Your App

In your Meta App Dashboard, go to the main **Dashboard** page and add the following products to your app:

- **Facebook Login for Business**
- **Messenger**
- **WhatsApp for Business**
- **Instagram**

## 4. Configure Webhooks

Navigate to the **Webhooks** section of your Meta App. You will need to configure webhook subscriptions for **Pages**, **Instagram**, and **WhatsApp Business**. Ensure you are using **API version 20.0** for all webhooks.

For each of the following subscriptions:

1.  Click **Edit Configuration**.
    - **Callback URL**: Enter the following URL, replacing `<your-domain>` with your actual domain:
      ```
      https://<your-domain>/messenger/webhook
      ```
    - **Verification Token**: Use the verification token you previously saved in the GPT-trainer Partners Dashboard.
2.  **Test** the **messages** webhook. You should see the message:
    > "The sample update was successfully sent to your server."
    > Then click **Subscribe** on **Messages**.
3.  If you experience duplicated messages after testing, **unsubscribe** from **Messages** and try the test and subscription again.

## 5. Configure Facebook Login for Business

Go to **Facebook Login for Business â†’ Configurations** in your Meta App Dashboard and create three separate configurations:

1.  **Messenger**

    - **Login Variation**: General
    - **Access Token**: User Access Token
    - **Authorizations**:
      ```
      pages_messaging
      instagram_basic
      instagram_manage_messages
      pages_show_list
      business_management
      pages_manage_metadata
      pages_read_engagement
      ```

2.  **Instagram**

    - **Login Variation**: General
    - **Access Token**: User Access Token
    - **Authorizations**:
      ```
      pages_messaging
      pages_show_list
      pages_manage_metadata
      pages_read_engagement
      instagram_basic
      instagram_manage_messages
      business_management
      ```

3.  **WhatsApp**

    - **Login Variation**: whatsapp_embedded_signup
    - **Resources**: WhatsApp account
    - **Authorizations**:
      ```
      whatsapp_business_management
      whatsapp_business_messaging
      business_management
      pages_manage_metadata
      pages_show_list
      ```

For each integration you wish to add (Facebook Messenger, Instagram, or WhatsApp), copy the **Configuration ID** found under the respective configuration in the "Facebook Login for Business" tab and paste it into your GPT-trainer Partners Dashboard.

## 6. Request Advanced Access

You will need to request **Advanced Access** for the following permissions by filling out the necessary form in your Meta App Dashboard:

1.  `pages_messaging`
2.  `pages_manage_metadata`
3.  `public_profile`
4.  `pages_show_list`
5.  `whatsapp_business_messaging`
6.  `instagram_basic`
7.  `instagram_manage_messages`
8.  `business_management`
9.  `pages_read_engagement`
10. `whatsapp_business_management`

**Important Notes for Approval:**

1.  To increase the likelihood of Meta's approval, include clear videos with on-screen text instructions demonstrating your integration setup.
2.  For `whatsapp_business_management` approval, your video must explicitly show the creation of an **ice-breaker** under: [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/phone-numbers/conversational-components\#ice-breakers](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/phone-numbers/conversational-components#ice-breakers)

## 7. Integrating with Existing Stripe Plans (Optional)

If you want to add Meta integrations to existing Stripe plans, ensure the metadata key `meta_integration` is set to `True` for those plans.
